# ðŸ˜… Requirements

### Hey, let's see if your PC is ready for PyTermOS!

#### 1.

Ensure that you have a Raspberry Pi. Only RPi's are supported, as mentioned previously.

#### 2.

A monitor with HDMI supported. VGA is not supported. (soon will add support)

#### 3.

An HDMI cable.&#x20;

#### 4.

A Keybord that should be always connected to your RPi.

#### 5.&#x20;

RPi Imager or simillar software.

#### 6.

A disk image of PyTermOS. Choose a version that you need, but ensure that the PyTerm version is not too old because PyTermOS would be no-sense to use.
